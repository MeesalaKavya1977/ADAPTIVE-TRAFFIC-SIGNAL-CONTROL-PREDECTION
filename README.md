# ADAPTIVE-TRAFFIC-SIGNAL-CONTROL-PREDECTION
By using machine learning with state-of-the-art, real-time object detection based on a deep Convolutional Neural Networks called You Only Look Once (YOLO). We can make the characteristics of the competing traffic that allows  the signalized road intersection.Â
